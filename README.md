# ToDoList
First attempt of: using JavaFX, MySQL Database

At this time, used Scene Builder for GUI->> not used CSS for styling


Done: Sign up page
      login page
      creating a to do list group,
      creating a task--PARTIAL,

IN progress: 
     after creating a task- need to be sorted
       by time
       by listgroup
     task's need to uploaded after logins(same as listGroups-which is done)
     
Conclusion:
  Java GUI looks limited, need to try client side: HTML/JavaScript  server side:PHP or Java
